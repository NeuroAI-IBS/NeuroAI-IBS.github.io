Before joining IBS in 2024, he served as a Postdoctoral Researcher (2007–2012) and Group Leader (2012–2024) in the Computational Neuroscience Unit at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Japan. Previously, he was a Senior Fellow in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics,  University of Washington, USA, during 2004–2007. He is a theoretical physicist by training and received his PhD in Physics from University of Pennsylvania in 2004. His research interests, broadly speaking, lie in uncovering biophysical underpinnings of computations performed by neural systems. He has been conducting computational modeling studies in collaboration with experimental neuroscientists to work on various topics ranging from single neuron computation to circuit-level mechanisms for circadian rhythm and cerebellum-dependent sensorimotor learning. His current research explores the interface between neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) research, focusing on the cerebellum and its interactions with other brain regions."><meta name=keywords content="neuroscience,AI,machine learning,computational neuroscience,IBS"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="Sungho Hong"><meta name=twitter:description content="Sungho Hong is a Senior Research Fellow in the Center for Memory and Glioscience at Institute for Basic Science (IBS) and the Principal Investigator of the Neuroscience-inspired AI group.
