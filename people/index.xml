Prior to joining CMG in 2022, he had been a Research Fellow at the Center for Neuroimaging Research, IBS-Sungkyunkwan University (2015-2022) and Postdoctoral Researcher at the School of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) (2011-2015). He got a PhD in Singal Processing from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras in 2011, based on his work on the OFDM systems. His current research work combines computational modeling and signal processing to gain mechanistic insights into the brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sungho Hong</title><link>https://ibs-neuroai-lab.github.io/people/sungho_hong/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ibs-neuroai-lab.github.io/people/sungho_hong/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Sungho Hong is a Senior Research Fellow in the Center for Memory and Glioscience at Institute for Basic Science (IBS) and the Principal Investigator of the Neuroscience-inspired AI group. He is also an Adjunct Professor in the &lt;a href="https://bme.unist.ac..kr" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Department of Biomedical Engineering&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://www.unist.ac.kr" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST)&lt;/a&gt;. Before joining IBS in 2024, he served as a Postdoctoral Researcher (2007–2012) and Group Leader (2012–2024) in the &lt;a href="https://www.oist.jp/research/research-units/cnu" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Computational Neuroscience Unit&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://www.oist.jp" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology&lt;/a&gt;, Japan. Previously, he was a Senior Fellow in the &lt;a href="https://nbio.uw.edu" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Department of Physiology and Biophysics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.uw.edu" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;University of Washington&lt;/a&gt;, USA, during 2004–2007. He is a theoretical physicist by training and received his PhD in Physics from &lt;a href="https://www.upenn.edu" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. His research interests, broadly speaking, lie in uncovering biophysical underpinnings of computations performed by neural systems. He has been conducting computational modeling studies in collaboration with experimental neuroscientists to work on various topics ranging from single neuron computation to circuit-level mechanisms for circadian rhythm and cerebellum-dependent sensorimotor learning. His current research explores the interface between neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) research, focusing on the cerebellum and its interactions with other brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
