Our group studies the biophysical basis of neural information processing through computational modeling, with particular emphasis on developing neuroscience-inspired machine learning/AI (neuroAI) models to analyze and model neuroscience data. We are big fans of physiological mechanisms and investigate how they collectively define the functions of neural systems underlying intelligent behavior. Currently, our research projects focus on the cerebellar neural circuit and its adaptive computation:

1. Computations for flexible movement control via the population activity of cerebellar neurons
2. Efficient construction of large-scale, physiologically realistic computational models of neural circuits
3. Modeling neuro-glia interactions and their impact on behavior

We carry out these projects in close collaboration with experimental labs both within our Center and abroad, providing rich opportunities for integrative research.
