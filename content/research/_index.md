Our group studies the biophysical basis of neural information processing through computational modeling, with particular emphasis on developing neuroscience-inspired machine learning/AI (neuroAI) models to analyze and model neuroscience data. We are big fans of physiological mechanisms and investigate how they collectively define the functions of neural systems underlying intelligent behavior. Currently, our research projects focus on the cerebellar neural circuit and its adaptive computation. Here are some of our current projects:

## Cerebellar circuit-level computations for flexible movement control


## Neuro-glia interactions and their impact on behavior


## Efficient construction of large-scale, physiologically realistic computational models of neural circuits


We carry out these projects in close collaboration with experimental labs both within our Center and abroad, providing rich opportunities for integrative research.

**We have multiple open positions for researchers at various levels.** If you are interested in joining us, please check out the [Open Positions]({{< ref "opportunities" >}}) page.
