Sungho Hong is a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Memory and Glioscience, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), and the Principal Investigator of the Neuroscience-inspired AI group. He is also an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST). Before joining IBS in 2024, he served as a group leader (2012–2024) and postdoctoral researcher (2007–2012) in the Computational Neuroscience Unit at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Japan. Previously, he was a Senior Fellow in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of Washington, USA during 2004–2007. He is a theoretical physicist by training and received his BS and MS degrees from KAIST in 1995 and 1999, respectively, and a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 2004, all in Physics. His research interests, broadly speaking, lie in uncovering biophysical underpinnings of computations that neural systems perform. By conducting computational modeling studies in collaboration with experimental neuroscientists, he has worked on various topics ranging from single neuron computation to circuit-level mechanisms for circadian rhythm and cerebellum-dependent sensorimotor learning. His current research explores the interface between neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) research, focusing on the cerebellum and its interactions with other brain regions.
