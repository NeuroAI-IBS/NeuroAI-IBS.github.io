**Postdoctoral Researchers, Senior Researchers, and Research Assistants**

The Neuroscience-inspired AI group at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS), South Korea, is actively seeking highly motivated researchers at multiple levels, including postdoctoral researchers, senior researchers, and graduate students.

Our group studies the biophysical basis of neural information processing through computational modeling, with particular emphasis on developing neuroscience-inspired machine learning/AI (neuroAI) models to analyze and model neuroscience data. Currently, our research projects focus on the cerebellar neural circuit and its adaptive computation (see [Research]({{< ref "research" >}}) for more details). We closely collaborate with experimental labs both within our Center and abroad, providing rich opportunities for integrative research. We are also next door to top-notch experimental laboratories in our Center and have various opportunities for scientific exchange also with other members of a vibrant neuroscience community in South Korea. We are stably supported internally by IBS, a South Korean government initiative for excellence in basic science research.

**Qualifications:** Successful candidates will hold a PhD (for postdoctoral/senior researchers) or a Master's degree (for research assistants) in neuroscience or related quantitative fields (Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, etc.) with strong interest in understanding neural systems through computational approaches. We are committed to welcoming applicants of all ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, religions, etc. The duration and salary will be determined based on the candidate's qualifications/experience and the IBS policy.

**How to Apply:** For further inquires, please contact the [PI]({{< ref "people/sungho_hong" >}}) with your CV and a brief statement of research interests.
