**Postdoctoral Researchers, Senior Researchers, and Research Assistants**

The Neuroscience-inspired AI group at the Center for Memory and Glioscience, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), South Korea, is seeking highly motivated scientists for open positions at multiple levels, including Postdocs, Senior Researchers, and Research Assistants.

Our group studies the biophysical basis of neural information processing through computational modeling, with particular emphasis on developing neuroscience-inspired machine learning/AI (neuroAI) models to analyze and model neuroscience data. We are big fans of physiological mechanisms and investigate how they collectively define the functions of neural systems underlying intelligent behavior (see [Research]({{< ref "research" >}}) for more details).

We closely collaborate with experimental labs both within our Center and abroad, providing rich opportunities for integrative research. We are also located next door to top-notch experimental laboratories in our Center and have various opportunities for scientific exchange with other members of a vibrant neuroscience community in South Korea. We are stably supported internally by IBS, a South Korean government initiative for excellence in basic science research. The duration and salary will be determined based on the candidate's qualifications and experience according to the IBS policy.

**Qualifications:** Successful candidates will hold a PhD (for Postdocs and Senior Researchers) or a Bachelor's degree (for Research Assistants) in neuroscience or related quantitative fields (Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, etc.), with strong interest in understanding neural systems through computational approaches. We are committed to welcoming applicants of all ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, religions, etc., as well as diverse scientific backgrounds. 

**How to Apply:** For further inquires, please feel free to contact the PI {{< email-icon "sunghohong@ibs.re.kr" >}}. Including your CV and a brief statement of research interests would be helpful. Note that inquiries prepared with excessive use of large language models will not be considered.
