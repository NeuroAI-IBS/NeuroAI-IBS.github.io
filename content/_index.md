# Welcome to the IBS NeuroAI Lab

We are a research group at the **Institute for Basic Science (IBS)** dedicated to understanding the brain through the lens of artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience.

## Our Mission

Our lab investigates the computational principles underlying neural systems, bridging neuroscience and machine learning to advance both fields.

## Research Areas

- **Computational Neuroscience** - Understanding neural computation and brain dynamics
- **Neural Network Models** - Developing biologically-inspired AI systems
- **Brain-Machine Interfaces** - Creating next-generation neural interfaces
- **Learning & Memory** - Computational models of learning and memory formation
