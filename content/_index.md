### Research

We are dedicated to understanding the biophysical basis of neural information processing through computational modeling, with particular emphasis on developing neuroscience-inspired machine learning/AI (neuroAI) models to analyze and model neuroscience data. We are big fans of physiological mechanisms and investigate how they collectively define the functions of neural systems underlying intelligent behavior. For our current research projects, see [here]({{< ref "research" >}}).
